#Setup the Intel Galileo

##Introduction

###In this tutorial you will...
  1. Get the Intel Galileo firmware updated and install necessary drivers
  2. Installing the Operating System (OS) on the Intel Galileo
  3. Installl the Arduino software development environment
  4. Run the example blinking light program on the Intel Galileo
  
##Explanation
 
 In order to start using the Intel Galileo, we will need to setup the board so that way we can push code to it. This requres
 installing drivers, flashing the board (if a gen 1 board), and setting up the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
 The Arduino IDE will allow us to easily write code and send commands to the Intel Galileo. 
 
##Required Materials
 
 1. Intel Galileo board
 2. Power and USB cable for Intel Galileo
 3. A computer with an internet connection
 4. A 4 Gigabyte(GB) SD card

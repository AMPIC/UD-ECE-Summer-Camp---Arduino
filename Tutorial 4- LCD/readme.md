# The Most Important Tool - The LCD Screen

## Introduction

### Topics to be Covered
  1. Learn about the LCD screen
  2. Modify LCD to change colors and content
  3. Display Important Data

## Explanation
This tutorial introduces one of the most useful items in our Seed kit, the LCD screen. An LCD screen is a backlit monitor screen, and we are going to learn how to use one and why it is so useful. We will alter already defined variables to change the color of the screen, and hopefully find a color we like, and then learn what we can display on the screen and the limitations of our screen. But enough of the explanation, lets get into the meat of this tutorial.

## Required Materials
  1. Intel Galileo and Grove shield
  2. Arduino IDE
  3. LCD Screen from Grove kit and a connector

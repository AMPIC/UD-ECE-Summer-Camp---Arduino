# Creating a Nightlight

## Introduction

### In this tutorial you will...
  1. Be introduced to the concepts of digital and analog signals
  2. Learn to use the light sensor, button, and potentiometer
  3. Build a working nightlight
  
## Explanation
 In order to start create...
 
## Required Materials
 1. Intel Galileo board kit and PC with Arduino IDE installed (see Tutorial 1)
 2. Grove shield
 3. Grove button
 4. Grove potentiometer
 5. Grove light sensor
 
## Digital vs. Analog Signals

### Digital Signals

## Building a Nightlight

### How it works
This is how a nightlight works...so logically our sensors should do the following...schematics...etc...

### Assembling the Sensors
Step by step on installing the sensors...

### A Look at the Code
How to open the code...undertanding what the code is doing (high level)...how to run the program

### Results
The night light should now be working...troubleshooting tips...pictures of it working...congrats!

## Summary
 
### In this tutorial we did the following.
 
  1. Learned about the difference between Digital and Analog signals.
  2. Introduced the light sensor, button, and potentiometer.
  3. Installed the physical components.
  4. Walked through the Nightlight logic and code.
  5. Relished in our vicotry. Hurrah! A nightlight!
